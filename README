# lein-fail-fast

Stop a testing run when the first test failure is received.

This is especially useful in a build server situation where you don't need to
finish out a test run once you know your tests have failed.

## Usage

Add as a development dependency to your lein project.clj, and turn on the
LEIN_FAIL_FAST environment variable in your build environment.

## Installation

Add lein-fail-fast as a development dependency to your lein project.clj and
robert-hooke as a non-dev dependency.
